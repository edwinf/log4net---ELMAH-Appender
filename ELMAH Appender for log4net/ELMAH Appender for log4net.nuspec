        <description>This appender will allow log4net to be configured to send log messages to ELMAH directly. This way ELMAH can be the log manager of record for sites while still allowing specific logging parameters to be controlled with log4net as usual.</description>
        <releaseNotes>
            *1.0.1 - Fix issue with MVC sites when the LogManager is created for the first time inside of the Application_Start function.  This fix includes a new property to set the ApplicationName value for ELMAH manually instead of trying to infer it from the HttpContext.
            *Also reduced the log4net dependancy to 1.10 or greater for those that don't want to upgrade to 1.11.
